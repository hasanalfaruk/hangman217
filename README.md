## Description
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word, and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts. This project is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word, and the user tries to guess it.

The aim of this project is to provide a fun and interactive way to play the Hangman game. In the process, I applied principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Version Control to create a real-world project. The code is organized, modular, and follows best practices.

## Installation
To run the Hangman game, follow these steps:
1. Download the source code from this repository.
2. Run the program using your preferred Python interpreter.

## Usage
Once the program is running, follow the prompts to guess letters and try to figure out the hidden word. The game will provide feedback on correct and incorrect guesses.

## File Structure
The project's file structure is organized as follows:
- `hangman.py`: The main Hangman game script.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
